# Human Following Robot 🤖

## Project Status
Work in Progress

## Description
This project is a human following robot using Arduino.
The robot follows a human based on distance measured using an ultrasonic sensor.

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Motor Driver (L298N)
- DC Motors
- Robot Chassis
- Battery

## Working Principle
The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance of the human.
If the human is within a set range, the robot moves forward.
If the human moves away, the robot stops.
